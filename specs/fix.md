# Fix Error

**Objective**: Resolve the error in thrown while `founder simulation agent pipeline`

Error in generating founder responses: 'LLMManager object has no attribut '\_rate_limit'

## Background

Analyse the streamlit_app.py and founder_simulation_agent.py to understand the flow of the project.

Analyse and come up with the reason behind the error mentioned above. Also, come up with resolution plan

## Analysis and Resolution

### Root Cause
The error `'LLMManager object has no attribute '_rate_limit'` occurs in the `generate_founder_responses` method of the `LLMManager` class. 

**Issue Location:** `src/utils/llm_manager.py:351`

**Root Cause:** Method name mismatch
- The new `generate_founder_responses()` method was calling `self._rate_limit()`
- However, the existing rate limiting method in LLMManager is named `self._enforce_rate_limit()`

### Code Flow Analysis
1. User uploads reference documents via Streamlit UI
2. `FounderSimulationAgent.process_simulation()` is called
3. Agent calls `self.llm_manager.generate_founder_responses(prompt)`
4. This method tries to call `self._rate_limit()` which doesn't exist
5. AttributeError is thrown

### Resolution Applied
**File:** `src/utils/llm_manager.py`
**Line:** 351
**Change:** 
```python
# Before (incorrect)
self._rate_limit()

# After (correct)
self._enforce_rate_limit()
```

### Validation
✅ Fix tested and validated:
- All imports successful
- Method exists and is callable
- Complete simulation pipeline tested
- No more AttributeError

### Status: RESOLVED ✅
