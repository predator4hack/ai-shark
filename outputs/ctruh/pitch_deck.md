### Problem

The document outlines two key problems: high barriers to entry for building immersive experiences due to complex software skills, robust computing requirements, and high human resource demands, and the lack of universal compatibility across devices for experiences developed on platforms like Unity and Unreal. These issues create unnecessary friction for businesses seeking to implement immersive experiences.

### Problem Analysis:

*   **Market Opportunity Hindrance:** The requirement for complex software skills and robust computing infrastructure creates a significant entry barrier.

    *   This implies that many businesses, especially smaller ones, are unable to leverage the potential of immersive experiences due to resource and expertise limitations.
    *   The "huge learning curve" mentioned exacerbates this issue, as it requires substantial investment in training and development.

*   **Fragmented User Experience:** Lack of universal device compatibility for experiences built on popular platforms like Unity and Unreal leads to additional friction.

    *   This suggests that businesses may have to develop multiple versions of their immersive experiences to cater to different devices, increasing development costs and complexity.
    *   The term "additional frictions" implies usability and accessibility issues for end-users, potentially impacting engagement and adoption rates.

*   **Core Issues:**
    *   **High Barrier to Entry:** Complexity and resource-intensive development are hindering broader adoption.
    *   **Device Compatibility:** Lack of universal compatibility creates a fragmented and potentially frustrating user experience.

*   **Implications:** This problem could be a massive opportunity for platforms or solutions that simplify the creation and deployment of immersive experiences, enabling wider access and universal device support.
