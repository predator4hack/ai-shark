# Market & Competition Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

Naario is a consumer goods startup in the Food & Beverage sub-sector, focusing on millet-based functional foods targeted at Indian women and families. The company aims to address the growing demand for healthy, sustainable, and locally-sourced food options, particularly for managing conditions like diabetes and PCOS.
