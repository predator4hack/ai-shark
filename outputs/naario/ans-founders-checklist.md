### 3. What is the specific rationale behind your current pricing tiers, and how have you tested these price points against customer willingness-to-pay and competitor offerings to validate your revenue per user assumptions?

Our pricing is based on a mix of market research, competitor analysis, and qualitative price sensitivity research within the Naario community, with a flat rate for end customers. We considered customer willingness-to-pay and competitor offerings, but specific details on testing and validation of revenue per user assumptions aren't available here.

Unfortunately, the documents provided do not contain a granular breakdown of gross margins or detailed direct costs for our primary product/service. Therefore, I am unable to answer this question fully.

### 16. Detail your current operational bottlenecks. For instance, what is your most manual or resource-intensive process today, and what is your timeline and budget for automating or optimizing it to support scaling?

Currently, our most resource-intensive process is onboarding and training our women microdistributors. While this channel drives a significant portion of our B2C revenue (40%), the manual training involved is a bottleneck. We are exploring digital training modules and expect to invest approximately Rs 5 lakhs over the next year to automate this process, enabling faster onboarding and scaling of our microdistributor network.

### 17. What is your intellectual property strategy beyond basic trademarking? Are there specific areas of technical innovation where you plan to seek patent protection, and what is your plan to monitor and enforce against potential infringers?

Beyond trademarking our brand, Naario, we are focusing on trade secrets related to our unique product formulations and manufacturing processes, particularly those related to AI applications in food innovation. Currently, we don't have plans for patents, but we are investing in robust documentation and access control to protect our proprietary knowledge. We will continuously monitor the market and re-evaluate our patent strategy as needed.

The document doesn't explicitly detail specific market shifts or regulatory changes we are anticipating. However, we are banking on the increasing adoption of AI in the CPG industry, which will enable us to optimize operations and product development further. If this adoption is slower than expected, we'll focus on refining existing processes and leveraging community feedback for product innovation to maintain our competitive edge.

### 20. Beyond general "better product" claims, what are the top three, quantifiable reasons your existing customers choose and *stay* with your solution over direct or indirect alternatives, and how do you measure these?

While the documents don't provide specific, quantifiable data on customer retention, we believe our customers choose and stay with Naario for three key reasons: the unique product offerings tailored to their needs, the strong community aspect fostered by our microdistributor network, and the perceived value reflected in our LTV of Rs 1100 in 6 months compared to a CAC of Rs 380 for D2C. We track LTV and repeat purchase rates to measure these factors.

### 23. Can you detail any customer or supplier concentration risks you currently face? What percentage of your revenue comes from your top 3 customers, and what would be the impact if one of them churned? What is your strategy to diversify these relationships?

Regarding customer concentration, the document doesn't explicitly state the revenue percentage from our top 3 customers. However, it notes that 40% of our B2C revenue comes from Amazon, making them a significant partner; losing them would necessitate a focus on our microdistributor network and D2C sales.

### 24. What are the top three operational bottlenecks or single points of failure that, if they were to fail, would most severely constrain your growth or service delivery? What redundant systems or processes are in place?

The document doesn't detail specific operational bottlenecks. However, potential single points of failure could be related to supply chain vulnerabilities or disruptions in our e-commerce platform. We would need redundant suppliers and robust e-commerce infrastructure to mitigate these risks.

### 25. Walk us through a negative scenario where your primary market shrinks by 25% or your CAC doubles. How would this impact your financial projections, and what specific strategic levers would you pull to adapt?

If our primary market shrinks by 25% or CAC doubles, it would negatively impact our financial projections, especially given our current CAC of Rs 380 for D2C. We would pull levers such as optimizing marketing spend, focusing on higher LTV customers, and exploring cost-effective acquisition channels while carefully monitoring our LTV:CAC ratio of
