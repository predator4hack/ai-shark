### 2. Can you provide a granular breakdown of your current and projected revenue streams, specifically detailing the percentage contribution of each stream, average revenue per user (ARPU) by segment, and the specific drivers for growth within each over the past 12 months?

Our current revenue is primarily from Product Sales, categorized as B2B (35%) and B2C (65%). Within B2C, 40% comes from Amazon, 40% from our Microdistributors, and 10% from D2C channels. While we have a clear breakdown of revenue contributions, specific average revenue per user (ARPU) by segment, precise growth drivers over the past 12 months for each stream, and projected revenue streams are not detailed in this document.

*Confidence: 80%*

*Based on: ref-founders-checklist.md*

### 3. Walk us through the underlying rationale for your current pricing tiers, particularly how they are benchmarked against direct and indirect competitors, and what specific evidence you have that customers perceive this value proposition as superior and worth the price?

Our pricing strategy employs a flat rate for all end customers, determined by a comprehensive approach combining market research, competitor analysis, and qualitative price sensitivity research conducted within the Naario community. While competitor analysis informs our pricing, specific benchmarking details against direct and indirect competitors, and explicit evidence demonstrating customer perception of superior value, are not further elaborated in this document.

*Confidence: 80%*

*Based on: ref-founders-checklist.md*

### 4. How do you calculate your Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), specifically detailing the inputs for churn rate by segment, gross margin, and average customer lifespan? What historical data validates these assumptions, and what is your precise strategy to improve LTV by 15% in the next 12 months?

We generate close to Rs 1100 in LTV over a 6-month period, demonstrating strong customer value. However, the specific inputs used for this calculation, such as churn rate by segment, gross margin, and average customer lifespan, are not detailed in this document. Additionally, historical data validating these assumptions and our precise strategy to improve LTV by 15% in the next 12 months are not provided here.

*Confidence: 80%*

*Based on: ref-founders-checklist.md*

### 5. What specific evidence do you have that your current unit economics (CAC, LTV, payback period) will remain favorable or improve as you scale user acquisition significantly, especially as you move beyond your initial target segments and acquisition channels?

Our current unit economics are favorable, with a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of Rs 380 for D2C and Rs 50 for partners, and an LTV of Rs 1100 in 6 months, yielding an LTV:CAC ratio of

### 6. Beyond current offerings, what specific, validated future revenue streams are you planning to launch within the next 18 months, and what is your timeline, resource allocation, and expected contribution for each of them?

While our current revenue streams are well-defined, comprising B2B (35%) and B2C (65% â€“ 40% Amazon, 40% Microdistributors, 10% D2C) product sales, the provided documents indicate that "Subscription fees, memberships" are currently not a source of recurring revenue. At this time, the available information does not detail specific, validated future revenue streams, their launch timelines, resource allocations, or expected contributions within the next 18 months.

*Confidence: 80%*

*Based on: ref-founders-checklist.md*

### 7. Provide a detailed monthly cash flow projection for the next 18 months, specifically highlighting the key assumptions for revenue growth, COGS, and operational expenses that underpin your runway calculation, along with a sensitivity analysis for these key variables.

Our current one-time revenue stands at approximately ~14L per month. However, the provided documentation does not include a detailed monthly cash flow projection for the next 18 months, nor does it outline specific assumptions for revenue growth, COGS, operational expenses, runway calculations, or a sensitivity analysis for these variables.

*Confidence: 80%*

### 8. Can you break down your Gross Margin into its direct cost components (e.g., specific software licenses, infrastructure, direct labor for service delivery) and detail your exact strategy and timeline for achieving a 10% improvement in gross margin percentage over the next 12 months?

The reference documents outline our pricing strategy and unit economics, including CAC and LTV, but do not provide a breakdown of our Gross Margin into its direct cost components (e.g., software licenses, infrastructure, direct labor). Furthermore, the documents do not detail a specific strategy or timeline for achieving a 10% improvement in gross margin percentage over the next 12 months.

### 11. Clarify how your reported MRR/ARR accounts for potential customer churn, downgrades, and non-recurring revenue, and how your revenue recognition policy aligns with your cash collection cycle, particularly for multi-year contracts or usage-based models.

Our current revenue model is entirely based on one-time product sales, generating approximately ~14L per month. We do not have recurring revenue streams like subscriptions or memberships, so concepts like MRR/ARR, customer churn, or multi-year contracts are not applicable at this stage. Our revenue recognition aligns with the point of sale for these one-time purchases.

### 26. If a well-funded incumbent or a new well-funded competitor enters your specific niche, what are your explicit defensive strategies, and what specific, proprietary assets or advantages do you possess that would make it exceptionally difficult for them to replicate your success?

Our explicit defensive strategies center around deeply understanding our niche and leveraging our community. We have a highly defined target audience (women 35+ in metro/T1 cities with HHI >10LPA) and utilize our "Naario community" for qualitative price sensitivity research, giving us unique insights into customer needs and willingness to pay that are difficult for competitors to replicate.

Yes, we do have customer concentration risk. Amazon represents 26% of our total revenue (40% of B2C, which is 65% of total), and our Microdistributors also represent 26% of total revenue. Additionally, our B2B segment contributes 35%. While the document outlines these current revenue channel contributions, it does not explicitly detail a specific, actionable strategy to diversify our customer base and reduce dependency on any single channel or partner.
