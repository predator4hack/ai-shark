## Questionnaire Responses

### 1. Founder Investment Questionnaire - Naario

Naario's core business model is centered on B2B, B2C, and B2B2C product sales, primarily targeting women aged 35 and above in metro/T1 cities with a household income north of 10LPA. Our revenue streams are robust, with 65% coming from B2C channels (40% Amazon, 40% Microdistributors, 10% D2C) and 35% from B2B, generating approximately 14L per month in one-time revenue.

### 2. Can you provide a detailed, segment-by-segment breakdown of your average customer lifetime value (LTV) and customer acquisition cost (CAC), specifically differentiating these metrics by your top three acquisition channels over the past 12 months?

We currently generate an average LTV of close to Rs 1100 over six months. Regarding CAC, we see variations across channels: D2C acquisitions cost Rs 380, while partners come in at about Rs

### 3. What is the specific rationale behind your current pricing tiers, and how have you tested these price points against customer willingness-to-pay and competitor offerings to validate your revenue per user assumptions?

Our pricing strategy is a flat rate for all end customers, derived from a combination of market research, competitor analysis, and qualitative price sensitivity research conducted within the Naario community. This comprehensive approach ensures our pricing is competitive and aligned with customer willingness-to-pay, validating our revenue assumptions.

### 6. Please provide a granular breakdown of your gross margins for your primary product/service offering, detailing all direct costs, and outline the specific initiatives planned to improve these margins by at least 5% within the next 18 months.

I appreciate the granular focus on margins. While the provided "Founders Checklist" document outlines our revenue streams, pricing strategy, and unit economics (LTV of Rs 1100 in 6 months and CAC varying from Rs 50 to Rs 380 depending on the channel), it does not contain a detailed breakdown of gross margins or direct costs per product, nor does it specify planned initiatives for a 5% margin improvement.
