About us Careers Claims Helpline Request a Demo Quick summary What Is Employer-Paid Health Insurance? When purchasing a group health insurance plan, the more coverage the better. While a standard plan covers only the basic needs in a health emergency, such as room rent and ambulance cover, there are several add-ons that make the policy more lucrative or beneficial. Â However, additional benefits are an extension of a standard health insurance plan and often come at an extra cost. Before purchasing them, itâs wise to evaluate what each add-on entails, and how it can add value to your existing cover. When youâre evaluating additional benefits, itâs also important to consider your employeesâ circumstances at the time of buying. For instance, if the majority of your workforce is young married women, you can assume they would plan to have kids. And so, itâs prudent to take maternity cover with your standard group health insurance plan. Similarly, if your employees are over the age of 50, it would be helpful to get a critical illness cover. Key Add-Ons On To Standard Group Health Insurance Plans Hereâs a list of important add-ons that you can add to your group health insurance plan. Top up cover: Standard group health insurance plans provide only for single hospitalization coverage. Buying...

About us Careers Claims Helpline Request a Demo Quick summary What Is Employer-Paid Health Insurance? India's Healthcare Crossroads India is at a crucial point in its healthcare journey. Our healthcare system has been underperforming for decades. While other countries progress, India's healthcare system has stagnated or even regressed. On average, Indians live to just 69 years, compared to 84 years in Japan. That's 15 fewer years of life per person. The health numbers in India are alarming: over 100 million diabetics, the world's highest rate of cardiovascular disease, not enough doctors or hospital beds, and unhealthy processed foods due to low awareness. Challenges We Face India's healthcare system has deep-rooted problems. We have too few doctors and hospital beds for our huge population. With just 5 hospital beds per 10,000 people and 1.2 million doctors for 1.4 billion citizens, doctors are overwhelmed. A typical doctor's visit lasts just 5 minutes, making it tough to understand a patient's medical history. Worse, the current "fee for service" model rewards doctors for doing procedures, not for improving long-term health. This results in reactive healthcare, focusing on treating illnesses, not preventing them. Patients often seek alternative treatments due to concerns about unnecessary ...
