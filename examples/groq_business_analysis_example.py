            Executive Summary: We are building an AI-powered financial analytics platform specifically designed for small and medium businesses (SMBs).

            Problem Statement: Small businesses lack access to the sophisticated financial insights and predictive analytics that larger companies enjoy. Most SMBs rely on basic accounting software that provides historical data but offers little forward-looking intelligence.

            Solution: Our SaaS platform provides AI-driven financial analysis, automated cash flow forecasting, and business intelligence dashboards. We make enterprise-grade financial analytics accessible and affordable for SMBs.

            Business Model: We operate on a tiered subscription model:
            - Basic Plan: $99/month for up to 1,000 transactions
            - Professional Plan: $299/month for up to 10,000 transactions with advanced analytics
            - Enterprise Plan: Custom pricing for unlimited transactions and white-label options

            We also charge transaction fees for premium AI features and offer API access for integration partners.

            Market Opportunity: The SMB financial software market is valued at $12B annually and growing at 15% YoY. Our addressable market includes 30 million SMBs in North America alone.

            Traction: We have 150 paying customers generating $450K in annual recurring revenue (ARR). We're experiencing 25% month-over-month growth with a 95% customer retention rate.

            Technology: Built on a cloud-native architecture using Python, React, and PostgreSQL. Our proprietary machine learning algorithms analyze transaction patterns to provide predictive insights. We've filed 2 patents for our financial forecasting technology.

            Competition: We compete with traditional players like QuickBooks and Xero but differentiate through our AI-powered insights, predictive analytics, and SMB-focused user experience.

            Team: Founded by experienced engineers from Stripe and Palantir with deep expertise in fintech and machine learning. Our team has previously built and scaled financial products serving millions of users.

            Funding: Currently raising a $5M Series A round to accelerate product development, expand our sales and marketing team, and pursue strategic partnerships with banks and accounting firms.
